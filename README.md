## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Developer with a unique blend of expertise in psychology and computer science. I combine a deep understanding of user behaviour and interaction alongside strong technical skills in Python, C#, and JavaScript to create intuitive and reliable applications. Proficient in full-stack development, immersive virtual and mixed reality (VR/MR) experiences, UX design, and cloud technologies, I drive innovation by seamlessly integrating the human and technical aspects of the software development life cycle within Agile teams. Committed to problemâ€‘solving and continuous learning, I strive to deliver user-centric solutions that meet and exceed expectations.
